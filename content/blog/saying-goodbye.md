I love being on vacation when there's no cell phone reception.

I do NOT like when cell reception becomes available and all the missed contact attempts flood onto my phone.  It feels like everybody wants a piece of me, and I'm not even officially back yet!  I suppose I don't haave to turn my phone on until I return home.  Hmmm perhaps.

Even when you know it's coming, you're never ready to hear the words that your friend has passed away.

A few years older than me, with 2 young kids, same ages as mine.
