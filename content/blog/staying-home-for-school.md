Back to school this month looks a lot different for us.

We're staying home for grade 3 and 5 and doing distanced learning through <a href="https://www.sides.ca/en/k-9-programs.html" target="_blank">SIDES</a>.
I took some courses through SIDES when I was in high school and really enjoye it.  I'm guessing my sons won't have to paper snail mail their math work into their teachers for grading and wait weeks, instead of seconds, for the results of their tests.  Yet another layer on the Generation Gap Sandwich / Cake / Mound.

The oldest who is 10, had wanted to try homeschooling for a year or so.  After spring break rolled into summer break, we were forced to try it and working from home went well so we thought we would give it a shot!

"You're brave"
"I couldn't do it"
"My kids need school"

Are a few of the comments I've heard..

This way we will also be able to travel around the world while we homeschool.  This is a dream of mine that I can't see my husband jumping on board with... but I want him with us and I can see him being dragged behind the yacht so, that's good enough for me.  Need to - ok WANT to - compete with the nude 365 Days yacht scenes by 44.
