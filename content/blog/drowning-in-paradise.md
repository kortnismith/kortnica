Drowning in Paradise
<<Reality Check>>.

Nov 1 2018

What do you do when you’ve achieved your childhood dreams - dream husband, children - live in a beautiful home, neighborhood, Country, barely have to work, nice friend & extended family-
blah blah blah --
And you’ve woken up unhappy, again, for the 2,354th time -roughly- in the last 6.5 years.

At least one major breakdown in there - and maybe a couple small ones - the kind where you start crying at work until someone politely tells you to go home, “Oh and call this 1-800-# as well, someone on there can probably help you…”

What do you do when you’re approaching 40 and supposed to be setting a good example for your children in life, running the family business, home, … and issues start to creep up in you like… someone opened a can of killer zombie worms on steroids… which sends you spiraling back to many points in your life, likely to deal with all the repressed bullshit no one in my family ever seemed to know how to handle - … anyhow - I digress.


I feel like I live in paradise, but I’m drowning.

Drowning in responsibilities, excess stuff, excess fat, excessive spending, loneliness - despite all the digital ways there are to connect.  I’m convinced many digital connections have less of a positive effect that fewer real live in person connections, over the phone?? Not sure… (one day when I get my metaphysics electro something frequency measuring device, we’ll test this!  What program can I take at University to get access to that equipment?!  Hmmmmmm).

Drowning in the rapids that feel like the results of lack of personal, one on one connection, lack of loyalty, lack of quality, lack of responsibility, lack of skill, lack of intelligence, lack of common sense, lack of connection with others - with self, lack of caring, lack of interest, lack of desire to participate, lack of awareness… and others…

Due to the evolutionary cycle we’re caught up in where the world does more and more to help us;  Like an over-protective mother trying to nurture her babes (and unknowingly making them less capable), doing whatever it can for us, charging us max price for it, and making us further dependant on it.  The cycle is terrifying.

I looked at our finances over the last few years and the truth behind them scared the shit out of me;

<OK I GET IT!  DO SOMETHING WITH FINANCES!!!!>
Help people with the direction.  Online quizzes.
