I was feeling victimmy about my messiness the other day as I noticed our clean house revert back to an untidy state.

I watched as our clean island in the kitchen seemed to slowly attract item after item to it's surface until there was a familiar size mound of everyone's crap.  I wondered why this kept happening.  Why was it so hard for me to keep things clean?

My husband puts his stuff away.  He's a neat and tidy guy.  He's proof that it's possible to put one's shit away.

What was my problem?

I stared at another pile of mine building up in our bathroom - then it hit me.

That mess, clutter and disorder was familiar to me.  Despite making me feel unsettled at a conscious level because I want my house clean organized and decorated like the homes I see in magazines, I could feel that some sad little part of me was comforted by the messiness.  Those piles of stuff were my security blankets.

I grew up with disorganized, mismatched, scattered parents so it's hard to feel comfortable in clean, organized spaces.

Ok there victim... enough of that.
I'm an adult (apparently) and I am responsible for my actions.

I will be clean and organized.

I am Super Queen of Clean and Organized.
starting right NOW!ÃŸ
