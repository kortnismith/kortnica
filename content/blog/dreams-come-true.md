In 2004ish, I watched The Secret, learned about the law of attraction, and when I've remembered to use it, it’s worked wonders for me.

Here are some of the things I dreamed up and got;

$15K Pay Raise
1st House (w/no $ down)
New Car
New Fiance
Dream Job
Husband Raise

Husband Raise: (TO DO put on it's own page...) When we decided I would not return to work sometime after having 2 kids, I said to my husband;

“I’m not going back to work soooo you should probably make more money now.  Can you get a raise?”

Turns out Chris was due for a raise so we talked about his asking for one.
