With blonde curly hair halfway down my back, one day I put it in a few pigtails, and cut them all off.  My girlfriend was about to lose her hair so I figured I'd join her.

When I was growing up, I'd always said that I would shave my head if one of my friends got cancer.  Based on the rate of cancer I'd seen, I felt like someone close to me was bound to get it.
"Thanks a lot!!", was my friends reply when I idiodically blurted that out to her.  What a jackass.

This is a frequent scenario for me:
(Random thought pops into my head)
Before I've finished the thought >> "That's interesting brain!  But do NOT say that out loud."
... I've blurted the random thought out.

Shaving my head was quite an experience.

Chris and the boys watched and took video.  I had a pretty intimate badass GI Jane moment in front of the miror with that shaver.  I <i>may</i> have been wearing a tank top as well.

I didn't realize how much of my identity was attached to my hair.  I also did not realize that the length of my hair mattered to other people.  But low and behold... it did!
After I shared something about my husband in comedy class, a tall older gentleman stuck in a dream about being a couch surfer / cracker jack / blunt instrument blurted out "You're married?  I totally had you pegged for a lesbian."

A lot of people seemed pretty disappointed that I cut it.  Like I had done them wrong somehow.  Taken away my curly locks so they were now forced to stare at my fuzzy head.

My scar looked pretty badass.  Ever since my first car accident when I cut my head open, I'd wanted to see my scar.  That was an alterior motive for shaving my head.  Also the curiosity of what I would look like with a buzz cut, and the soothing knowledge that soon I could rub my freshly shaven head anytime I wanted to... until it grew out.
