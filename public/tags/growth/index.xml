      <description>I was feeling victimmy about my messiness the other day as I noticed our clean house revert back to an untidy state.
I watched as our clean island in the kitchen seemed to slowly attract item after item to it&amp;rsquo;s surface until there was a familiar size mound of everyone&amp;rsquo;s crap. I wondered why this kept happening. Why was it so hard for me to keep things clean?
