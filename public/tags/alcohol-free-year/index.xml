      <description>The last sip of beer I had was Oct 7th, 2019.
It has been one year since that date and now&amp;hellip;
My liver is thanking me.
I&amp;rsquo;ve regretted our investment in our friend&amp;rsquo;s local Brewery on more than one occasion. Especially when they released a couple new beer that almost broke me. The berry sours. Ohhh gawd the berry sours.
I needed to spend some sober time away from the bottle.</description>
