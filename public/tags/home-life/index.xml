      <description>Back to school this month looks a lot different for us.
We&amp;rsquo;re staying home for grade 3 and 5 and doing distanced learning through SIDES. I took some courses through SIDES when I was in high school and really enjoye it. I&amp;rsquo;m guessing my sons won&amp;rsquo;t have to paper snail mail their math work into their teachers for grading and wait weeks, instead of seconds, for the results of their tests.</description>
