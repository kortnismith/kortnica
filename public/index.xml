      <description>I was feeling victimmy about my messiness the other day as I noticed our clean house revert back to an untidy state.
I watched as our clean island in the kitchen seemed to slowly attract item after item to it&amp;rsquo;s surface until there was a familiar size mound of everyone&amp;rsquo;s crap. I wondered why this kept happening. Why was it so hard for me to keep things clean?
My husband puts his stuff away.</description>

      <description>Back to school this month looks a lot different for us.
We&amp;rsquo;re staying home for grade 3 and 5 and doing distanced learning through SIDES. I took some courses through SIDES when I was in high school and really enjoye it. I&amp;rsquo;m guessing my sons won&amp;rsquo;t have to paper snail mail their math work into their teachers for grading and wait weeks, instead of seconds, for the results of their tests.</description>

      <description>The last sip of beer I had was Oct 7th, 2019.
It has been one year since that date and now&amp;hellip;
My liver is thanking me.
I&amp;rsquo;ve regretted our investment in our friend&amp;rsquo;s local Brewery on more than one occasion. Especially when they released a couple new beer that almost broke me. The berry sours. Ohhh gawd the berry sours.
I needed to spend some sober time away from the bottle.</description>

      <title>What I Learned From Shaving My Head</title>

      <description>With blonde curly hair halfway down my back, one day I put it in a few pigtails, and cut them all off. My girlfriend was about to lose her hair so I figured I&amp;rsquo;d join her.
When I was growing up, I&amp;rsquo;d always said that I would shave my head if one of my friends got cancer. Based on the rate of cancer I&amp;rsquo;d seen, I felt like someone close to me was bound to get it.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>

      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>I love being on vacation when there&amp;rsquo;s no cell phone reception.
I do NOT like when cell reception becomes available and all the missed contact attempts flood onto my phone. It feels like everybody wants a piece of me, and I&amp;rsquo;m not even officially back yet! I suppose I don&amp;rsquo;t haave to turn my phone on until I return home. Hmmm perhaps.
Even when you know it&amp;rsquo;s coming, you&amp;rsquo;re never ready to hear the words that your friend has passed away.</description>
